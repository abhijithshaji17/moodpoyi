### Project Description📖
Our project "MoodPoyi" is Useless😭. Wanna hear music we'll make your day! 
### Working principle⚙️: 
Our Project fundamentally relies on examining the facial expressions of an individual using the webcam and playing the music rather opposite to it🙈.  
### Features👾: 
1. Emotion Mapping
2. Theme Reflection
3. Music Sync
4. Moodbuster

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)🤔
We all hear music just every other free-time! these days, right? The rhythm.. the tune.. echoes of it follows us in our mood all throughout the day. But what if, we hear the opposite unintended one?? it'll be funny right🙃? 

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)💡
Our ultimate aim was to build something useless. Still we need a solution because every problem in this world has a solution. 

*The Fix🛠️*

The Best thing would be to build a mood harmonizer that recognizes and plays the right music for your mood via perfect emotion mapping and music selection.
